# Global AI Hub Project - Rock Paper Scissors Game
This repository contains a project I completed during the Aygaz Python Bootcamp, which was part of the 10MillionAI initiative run by Global AI Hub. 
# Overview
Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors Game** created by Laçin Boz! This is a simple, interactive game that you can play against the computer. The game follows the classic rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors, with a twist—you'll be playing multiple rounds until one player wins two rounds.

# How to Play

## Start the Game
When you run the game, you’ll be greeted with a welcome message and a menu with four options.

## Menu Options
1. **Enter Player Name**: You can enter your name here. After entering your name, you'll be asked if you're ready to play.
2. **Show Rules**: This option displays the rules of the game.
3. **Play a Game**: Start the game! You’ll face off against the computer in a best-of-three match.
4. **Exit the Game**: Quit the game and exit.

## Game Rules
- The game is played in rounds. In each round, both you and the computer will choose one of three actions: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Rock** smashes **Scissors**.
- **Paper** covers **Rock**.
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper**.
- The first player (you or the computer) to win two rounds wins the game.

## Playing the Game
- After selecting "Play a Game", you will enter a match where you will choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering the corresponding number (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors).
- The computer will also make a random choice.
- The winner of each round will be announced, and the scores will be updated.
- The match continues until one player wins two rounds.
- After the match, you'll be asked if you want to play again. If both you and the computer agree, a new match will start. Otherwise, the game will return to the main menu or end.

## Exiting the Game
You can exit the game anytime by selecting "4: Exit the Game" from the main menu or by declining to play another match after a game ends.

## Installation & Setup
No installation is required. Simply run the Python script in an environment that supports Python 3.x.
